# yourselftoscience.org
**YourselfToScience.org is an open-source website providing a comprehensive list of services that allow individuals to contribute to scientific research with their data, genome, body, and more.**

Welcome to the official repository! Whether you're a developer looking to fix a bug or a community member with a suggestion for a new service, your contribution is welcome. Please see our [**Contribution Guidelines**](CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.

**Our Core Values:**

*   **Transparency:**  The entire project, from the website code to the content, is openly licensed and available on GitHub. We are committed to open development and openly licensed resources.
*   **Collaboration:**  This is a community-driven project! We actively encourage contributions, suggestions for new services, and improvements to the website.  Use the "Suggest a Service" button on the website or open issues/pull requests here on GitHub.
*   **Accessibility:** We strive to make contributing to science accessible to everyone.  The website is designed to be user-friendly, and  to present information in a clear and understandable way for both technical and non-technical users. Furthermore, we are committed to data reusability, making the resource list easily downloadable in formats like CSV to facilitate further analysis and use.

## A Quick Guide to Our Files

For those who are not developers, navigating a code repository can sometimes be confusing. Here's a quick guide to some of our most important files:

*   **`src/app/icon.svg`**: This is the main logo for the entire Yourself To Science project. Although named `icon.svg`, it functions as our primary logo. We use this specific name and location because it allows the Next.js framework to automatically handle all favicon and icon variations for different devices and platforms, which is a modern best practice.
*   **`src/data/resources.js`**: This file contains the raw data for all the services and resources listed on the website. If you are suggesting changes or additions, this is where the data lives.
*   **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: The most important file for anyone who wants to help! It contains detailed instructions on how to suggest new services, report issues, or contribute code.
