# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct describes how we expect people to behave in spaces run by Yourself to Science™.

Our goal is simple: build the world’s simplest way for anyone, anywhere, to contribute to science. To do that, we need community spaces that stay focused on science, data, and useful discussion — not on personal attacks or unrelated fights.

This Code applies to all interactions in official Yourself to Science spaces, including GitHub issues and pull requests, project discussions, and any other channels listed in the documentation.

## Canon 1 – Integrity

- Do not misrepresent data, sources, or your own role or expertise.
- Make a clear distinction between evidence, opinion, and speculation when you contribute.
- You are welcome to share tools, services, or resources you are involved with, as long as they are relevant and discussed on their merits.

## Canon 2 – Conduct in Community Spaces

- Do not harass, threaten, or deliberately intimidate anyone.
- Do not use personal attacks, slurs, or targeted insults.
- Keep discussion roughly on-topic for this initiative and the specific thread (issues, pull requests, or discussions).
- Do not use project spaces to provide personalised medical advice or to ask others for diagnoses or treatment decisions.

## Canon 3 – Collaboration and Review

- Focus comments and reviews on ideas, data, and code — not on personal characteristics.
- When you disagree, explain why in clear terms and, where possible, point to evidence or alternatives.
- Maintainers may close or redirect threads that become repetitive, off-topic, or hostile.

## Canon 4 – Use of the Yourself to Science’s Name and Infrastructure

- Do not present unofficial work as if it were an official part of Yourself to Science.
- Do not use project spaces to run unrelated political campaigns or personal attacks.
- Do not claim project endorsement for products, services, or organizations without explicit permission from the maintainers.

## Canon 5 – External Opinions and Politics

- You are free to hold and express any views elsewhere. In project spaces, keep discussion tied to Yourself to Science’s purpose: helping people discover and evaluate ways to contribute to science.
- Avoid importing external political or cultural fights into project channels when they are not directly relevant to the work.

## Canon 6 – Reporting and Consequences

If you believe this Code of Conduct has been violated in project spaces, you can report it by contacting the maintainers at conduct@yourselftoscience.org or via the channels listed in the project documentation.

Maintainers may respond to violations in one or more of the following ways, depending on severity and context:

- Clarifying expectations in the relevant thread.
- A private or public warning.
- Limiting or removing a person’s ability to participate in some or all project spaces.

Maintainers should not retaliate against anyone who reports a concern in good faith.
