## Contributing Content & Ideas (For Everyone!)

This is the place for you if you're not a developer but want to help improve the content of the site. Your contributions are the lifeblood of this project!

### What is a GitHub "Issue"?

Think of an "Issue" as a task or a conversation about a specific piece of work. It's how we track everything that needs to be done. You don't need to know how to code to create or comment on an Issue. It's our project's main forum for collaboration.

You can see all the open Issues [here](https://github.com/yourselftoscience/yourselftoscience.org/issues).

### How to Suggest a New Service

This is one of the most important ways you can contribute! If you know of a service that allows people to contribute to science, we want to hear about it.

1.  **Go to the "Issues" tab** at the top of our GitHub page.
2.  **Click the "New issue" button.**
3.  **Find the "Suggest a service" template and click "Get started".**
4.  **Fill out the form** with as much information as you can. The more details you provide, the faster we can review and add the service.
5.  **Click "Submit new issue".** That's it! The team will be notified and will review your suggestion.

### How to Report a Bug or Suggest an Improvement

If you see something wrong on the site or have an idea to make it better:

1.  **Go to the "Issues" tab.**
2.  **Click the "New issue" button.**
3.  Choose either the **"Bug report"** or **"Feature request"** template.
4.  Fill in the details and submit.

## Contributing Code (For Developers)

We welcome contributions from developers! If you're interested in fixing a bug or adding a new feature, here's how to get started.

### Local Development Setup

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/yourselftoscience.org.git`
3.  **Navigate** into the project directory: `cd yourselftoscience.org`
4.  **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
5.  **Run the development server:** `npm run dev`

This will start the website on `http://localhost:3000`. The `dev` command also runs a watcher script that will automatically update the PDF file when you make changes to the resources.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1.  Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix.
2.  Make your changes and commit them with a clear, descriptive message.
3.  Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
4.  Open a **Pull Request** from your fork to the `main` branch of the `yourselftoscience/yourselftoscience.org` repository.
5.  In the Pull Request description, please link to the Issue that your code addresses (e.g., "Closes #123").
6.  The team will review your code, and once approved, it will be merged.

Thank you for helping make science more accessible!
